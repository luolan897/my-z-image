## ✨ Features

- **Dual AI Providers**: Seamlessly switch between **Hugging Face** and **Gitee AI** providers to access different model ecosystems and quotas.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Access diverse models including:
  - Hugging Face: `Z-Image Turbo`, `Qwen Image Fast`, `Ovis Image`
  - Gitee AI: `Z-Image Turbo`, `Qwen Image`
- **Prompt Optimization**: Integrated AI prompt enhancer that expands simple ideas into detailed, cinematic descriptions (powered by Pollinations.ai for HF and Qwen3 for Gitee).
- **Advanced Controls**: Fine-tune your creations with adjustable **inference steps**, **seed control**, and **HD Mode** (High Definition).
- **History Gallery**: Automatically saves generated images locally. View, zoom, pan, and manage your creation history.
- **4x Resolution**: AI upscaling technology to increase image resolution up to 4x (Supported on Hugging Face).
- **Multilingual**: Full support for English and Chinese (中文) interfaces.
- **Token Management**: Configure personal API tokens for higher rate limits and stability.
- **Privacy Focused**: History is stored in your browser's LocalStorage; no backend database is required for user data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn or pnpm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amery2010/peinture.git
   cd peinture
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📦 Deployment

This project is a static Single Page Application (SPA), making it easy to deploy on any platform that supports static hosting.

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is optimized for frontend frameworks and requires zero configuration.

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. Run the deploy command from the project root:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. Follow the prompts. Vercel will automatically detect Vite and set the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `dist`.

**Alternatively, via the Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Import the repository in Vercel.
3. Keep the default "Framework Preset" as `Vite`.
4. Click **Deploy**.

### Option 2: Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare Pages is the best way to host static assets on the Cloudflare network.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Log in to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and go to **Compute (Workers & Pages)** > **Create Application** > **Pages** > **Connect to Git**.
3. Select your repository.
4. In "Build settings":
   - **Framework preset**: `Vite`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `dist`
5. Click **Save and Deploy**.

### Option 3: Static CDN (Nginx, Apache, Netlify, S3)

To host on any standard web server or CDN:

1. Build the project locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. This will generate a `dist` folder containing `index.html` and bundled assets.

3. Upload the **contents** of the `dist` folder to your server's public root directory (e.g., `/var/www/html` or an S3 bucket).

4. **Important for SPAs**: Ensure your server is configured to redirect all 404 requests to `index.html` so that React Router (if added in the future) or client-side logic handles the routing.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure API tokens in the app's **Settings** menu.

### Hugging Face Token (Optional)
The application works out-of-the-box using public quotas. However, for heavy usage or during peak times, providing your own token is recommended.
1. Get a token from [Hugging Face Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
2. Paste it into the **Hugging Face Token** field in Settings.

### Gitee AI Token (Required for Gitee)
To use the Gitee AI provider, you must provide an API token.
1. Get a token from [Gitee AI Dashboard](https://ai.gitee.com/dashboard/settings/tokens).
2. Paste it into the **Gitee AI Token** field in Settings.
3. Gitee AI provides a daily free quota for generated images.

*Tokens are stored securely in your browser's `localStorage` and are strictly used to authenticate requests to the respective Inference endpoints.*
